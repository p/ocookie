ocookie - a comprehensive cookie library for Python
===================================================

**ocookie** aims to be an easy to use and comprehensive library for
working with cookies. While Python has several cookie-related libraries
in its standard library, they have incompatible interfaces and do not
expose all of the data and operations that one might need. **ocookie**
strives to provide a layered API suitable for all cookie-related tasks,
be they low level or high level, in a single library.

The documentation is in ``doc`` subdirectory.

Tests
-----

Execute the test suite by running ``nosetests``.

The test suite uses some nose features and will not work with unittest alone.
